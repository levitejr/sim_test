      Boundaries:
      Rd → [R0 - R31]
  
      Operation:
      Rd = Rd • Rd`,
    XCH: `
      Syntax:   XCH Z, Rd
      Family:   Data Transfer Instructions
      Function: Exchanges one byte indirect between register and data space using Z as a pointer to the data memory cell
  
      Boundaries:
      Rd → [R0 - R31]
  
      Operations:
      (Z) ← Rd
      Rd ← (Z)`,

      Program Counter
  
      The purpose of the program counter is to store what line of the PMEM to execute next. The line number will be highlighted in blue to help show what line.`,
    SP: `
      Stack Pointer
  
      The purpose of the stack pointer is to store the location of the top of the stack. In AVR the stack pointer points to the line above the top value on the stack.`,
    X: `
      Definition: X means R27:R26 (two registers read as one 2 byte number)
      
      Calculation: Value of X = (R27 * 256) + R26
      
      Purpose: X is used to store the 2 byte address of a cell in DMEM. It is used in load and store instructions as a pointer to the relevant cell.`,
    Y: `
      Definition: Y means R29:R28 (two registers read as one 2 byte number)
      
      Calculation: Value of Y = (R29 * 256) + R28
      
      Purpose: Y is used to store the 2 byte address of a cell in DMEM. It is used in load and store instructions as a pointer to the relevant cell.`,
    Z: `
      Definition: Z means R31:R30 (two registers read as one 2 byte number)
      
      Calculation: Value of Z = (R31 * 256) + R30
      
      Purpose: Z is used to store the 2 byte address of a cell in DMEM. It is used in load and store instructions as a pointer to the relevant cell.`,
